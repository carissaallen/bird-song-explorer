# Audio Duration Fix - Smart Trimming âœ…

## Problem Solved
The nature sounds were playing for 30 seconds total, even though intro speech was only ~4 seconds. This created unnecessarily long files with 25+ seconds of just nature sounds after the voice ended.

## Solution Implemented

### Dynamic Duration Detection
The mixer now:
1. **Detects intro duration** using `ffprobe` (~3.9-4.9 seconds for your intros)
2. **Calculates optimal mix length**: Lead-in + Voice + Fade-out
3. **Trims automatically** to match the intro length

### New Audio Structure

#### Before (Fixed 30 seconds):
```
0-2.5s  : Nature sounds lead-in
2.5-7s  : Voice speaking (4.5s intro)
7-30s   : 23 seconds of just nature sounds! ðŸ˜±
```

#### After (Dynamic ~7 seconds):
```
0-2s    : Nature sounds fade in (25% volume)
2-6s    : Voice with soft nature background (10% volume)
6-7s    : 1 second fade out after voice ends
```

## Timing Breakdown

For a typical 4-second intro:
- **2 seconds**: Nature sound lead-in before voice
- **4 seconds**: Voice plays with nature background
- **1 second**: Fade out after voice ends
- **Total**: ~7 seconds (not 30!)

## Test Results

| Intro File | Voice Duration | Total Mix | File Size |
|------------|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| intro_00_Antoni.mp3 | 4.73s | 7.73s | 0.16 MB |
| intro_03_Antoni.mp3 | 3.89s | 6.89s | 0.14 MB |
| Previous (30s) | 4.73s | 30s | 0.72 MB |

**Size reduction**: From 0.72 MB to 0.16 MB (78% smaller!)

## Code Changes

### Key Addition in `intro_mixer.go`:
```go
// Get intro duration using ffprobe
introDuration := im.getAudioDuration(introFile)

// Calculate timings for short intro
leadInTime := 2.0      // Nature sounds lead-in
fadeOutTime := 1.0     // Fade out after voice
totalDuration := leadInTime + introDuration + fadeOutTime
```

### FFmpeg Parameters Updated:
- Changed from fixed `-t 30` to dynamic `-t %.2f` based on intro length
- Uses `duration=first` in amix to stop when voice ends
- Fade out starts exactly when voice finishes

## Benefits

1. **Smaller files**: ~80% size reduction
2. **Better UX**: No awkward silence after intro
3. **Natural flow**: Smooth transition from nature â†’ voice â†’ fade
4. **Automatic**: Works with any intro length

## Configuration

You can adjust these timings in `intro_mixer.go`:
```go
leadInTime := 2.0    // Seconds of nature before voice (default: 2)
fadeOutTime := 1.0   // Fade duration after voice (default: 1)
```

## Testing

Test with any intro:
```bash
go run cmd/test_nature_mix/main.go \
  -intro ./final_intros/intro_00_Antoni.mp3 \
  -type morning_birds \
  -output test.mp3
```

The output will show the detected duration and final mix length.
