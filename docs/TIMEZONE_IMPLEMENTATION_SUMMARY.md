# User Timezone Implementation - Complete ✅

## What We Built

We've successfully implemented a system that captures the user's current timezone and uses it to select appropriate nature sounds for their time of day.

## Key Components

### 1. **User Time Helper** (`user_time_helper.go`)
- Converts device timezone to local time
- Determines appropriate nature sound based on hour
- Provides time-based greetings and context

### 2. **Timezone Logger** (`timezone_logger.go`)
- Logs all timezone usage to JSON files
- Tracks which nature sounds are played when
- Generates usage statistics

### 3. **Enhanced Webhook Handler**
- Captures `GeoTimezone` from Yoto device config
- Passes timezone through content creation flow
- Logs comprehensive timezone data

### 4. **Audio Manager Updates**
- `IsNatureMixEnabled()` - Check if mixing is enabled
- `GetRandomIntroWithNatureForTimezone()` - Get timezone-aware intro
- Logs nature sound selection per user

## How It Works

```
User plays card → Webhook triggered → Get device timezone → Calculate local time → Select nature sound → Mix with intro
```

### Example Flow:
1. **New York user at 7am**: Gets "morning_birds" (dawn chorus)
2. **London user at 6pm**: Gets "gentle_rain" (evening sounds)
3. **Sydney user at 2am**: Gets "night" (crickets & owls)

## Nature Sound Schedule

| User's Local Time | Sound Type | Description |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|
| 5am - 9am | `morning_birds` | Dawn chorus, birds waking |
| 9am - 12pm | `forest` | Active forest sounds |
| 12pm - 5pm | `meadow` | Open field ambience |
| 5pm - 8pm | `gentle_rain` | Calming rain sounds |
| 8pm - 10pm | `stream` | Peaceful water sounds |
| 10pm - 5am | `night` | Crickets, owls, night sounds |

## Testing

### Test Commands:
```bash
# Test specific timezone
go run cmd/test_user_timezone/main.go -tz "America/New_York"

# Test all timezones
go run cmd/test_user_timezone/main.go -all

# Test with mixing simulation
go run cmd/test_user_timezone/main.go -tz "Europe/London" -mix
```

### Test Results:
- ✅ Correctly identifies user's local time from device timezone
- ✅ Selects appropriate nature sounds for time of day
- ✅ Logs all timezone usage for monitoring
- ✅ Falls back gracefully if timezone unavailable

## Configuration

### Environment Variables:
```bash
USE_NATURE_SOUNDS=true      # Enable/disable nature mixing
NATURE_SOUND_VOLUME=0.1     # Background volume (10%)
INTRO_DELAY_SECONDS=2.5     # Delay before voice starts
```

## Logging

All timezone usage is logged to `logs/timezone/timezone_YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-08-31T09:54:25Z",
  "device_id": "device123",
  "timezone": "Europe/London",
  "local_time": "17:54:25",
  "local_hour": 17,
  "nature_sound": "gentle_rain",
  "time_period": "early_evening"
}
```

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Curate Nature Sounds**:
   - Download 2-3 high-quality recordings for each time period
   - Store locally in `assets/nature_sounds/`
   - Normalize volume levels

2. **Pre-mix Intros** (Optional):
   ```bash
   go run cmd/mix_intros/main.go -all
   ```

3. **Monitor Usage**:
   - Review timezone logs to understand user patterns
   - Adjust nature sound schedule based on feedback

## Benefits

1. **Contextual Experience**: Users hear nature sounds appropriate to their time
2. **Global Support**: Works across all timezones automatically
3. **Privacy-Focused**: Only uses timezone, not GPS location
4. **Performance**: Caches results, minimal latency
5. **Insights**: Detailed logging shows usage patterns

## Sample API Response

When a card is played, the webhook now returns:
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Card updated with American Robin for New York",
  "deviceTimezone": "America/New_York",
  "userLocalTime": "07:30:15",
  "userHour": 7,
  "natureSound": "morning_birds",
  "timePeriod": "morning"
}
```

## Architecture Decision Confirmed

**Curated Library + Runtime Mixing** is now fully implemented:
- ✅ User timezone captured from device
- ✅ Nature sounds selected based on local time
- ✅ Runtime mixing capability ready
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for monitoring

The system is ready for you to add your curated nature sounds!
