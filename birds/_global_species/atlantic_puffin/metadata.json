    "Puffin chicks are known as \"pufflings.\"",
    "Half of North America's Atlantic Puffins breed in one location: Witless Bay, Newfoundland, Canada.",
    "The oldest recorded Atlantic Puffin was banded as a chick in Norway and lived to be 41 years old. But it's likely puffins can live even longer than that; it's only relatively recently that bands durable enough to last 40 years have come into wide use."
