# Bird Song Explorer 

> A smart Yoto card that brings local birds to your child's speaker every day. Wake up to the actual birds singing in your neighborhood, learn fun facts, and develop a connection with nature‚Äîall through the magic of a Yoto card.

4. **Bird Explorer's Guide** - Fun, educational facts about the bird (for kids and adults!)
5. **See You Tomorrow!** - A playful outro with jokes, fun facts, or a challenge tailored for young explorers
